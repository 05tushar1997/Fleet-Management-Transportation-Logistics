## Introduction

Welcome to the Fleet Management Transportation & Logistics Dashboard project! This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics and insights for managing and optimizing fleet operations in the transportation and logistics sector. It leverages data from various aspects of fleet management, including deliveries, drivers, fleets, operational costs, shipments, and trip status.

## Objective

The objective of the Fleet Management Transportation & Logistics Dashboard is to provide fleet managers and logistics coordinators with a powerful, data-driven tool to monitor, analyze, and optimize their operations. This dashboard aims to:

1. **Enhance Visibility:** Offer real-time insights into the status of deliveries, driver performance, and fleet utilization to ensure smooth and efficient operations.
2. **Optimize Costs:** Track and manage operational costs including driver wages and fuel expenses to identify cost-saving opportunities.
3. **Improve Decision-Making:** Provide comprehensive and actionable data that supports strategic planning and decision-making in fleet management.
4. **Streamline Operations:** Facilitate the efficient management of shipments and trips, helping to reduce delays and improve customer satisfaction.
5. **Support Resource Management:** Enable effective allocation and utilization of fleet resources to maximize productivity and efficiency.

By integrating and visualizing data from various aspects of fleet management, the dashboard helps organizations to achieve greater operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve service delivery.

### Data Sources

The dashboard is built using data from six primary tables:
